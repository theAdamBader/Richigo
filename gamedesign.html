                I am currently working on a project whilst coming up with other concepts of future projects, as 
                a Game Designer, I enjoy coming up with concept designs and how the project should play and feel. 
                I focus on how the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics of each project and how they should be played as 
                consumers will look at the aesthetics of the game first then the dynamics (which is the gameplay) and 
                finally the mechanics of how each input would affect the game.

            <p>Here are some projects that I am currently working on:</p>

            <p>
                Project JunkRace, the initial idea was to create a mobile game that was a karting game with steam-punk, 
                post-apocalyptic elements presented throughout. To make the experience a lot more different from other karting 
                games was the apply cool-downs and character specific vehicles to the game. The inspirations for the game took 
                elements from other games such as Mario kart, Overwatch and League of Legends.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Each character would also have their own specific abilities on a cool-down timer, which would have to be 
                thoroughly tested to see which can be over-used and over-powered. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were plans to either make characters have character specific cool-downs or just cool-down abilities that every 
                character can use. We already thought to restrict the abilities to 2 cool-downs and 1 Ultimate ability.  Even though 
                the initial idea of cool-downs was interesting, it was decided that with the character specific cool-downs it would only 
                be limited to 2 cool-downs per character without having the need to change them so they would be fixed and easier to understand.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the idea was to have at least 6 different characters that have different vehicles/play-styles, with the decision 
                of splitting the characters into two separate but easy to understand classes; one class being light and the other being heavy 
                vehicles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the beginning or the prototype stage, two stages were created for the racers. One was a moving spider stage whilst the other was 
                a simple canyon looking arena. Both of these stages had their own secrets to uncover to make them more interesting for the 
                player, mostly they had just shortcuts to allow for diverse play.

                This project was more of a conceptual story project focusing around telling a dream-like story. It was designed around 
                the idea of a person’s emotions and the emotional journey one would go on through a dreamscape.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The basic concept of the story is that our protagonist goes through a list of emotions in one day. The character will 
                progressively experience loss during this journey and it was going to show how the character comes to terms with what 
                is happening around him and how he deals with it; what solution would they come to when the reach the end of the road. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I developed the idea and extensive research on the different types of emotions a person emanates, however when creating 
                this concept, the original plan was to make clear separations of each emotion which can be difficult because a majority 
                of them can co-exist together when expressing them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The key emotions that are expressed from people are split as follows: happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and trust. 
                Using this knowledge, they would have to be arranged in order to make a more coherent storyline, where the good emotions 
                are presented at the beginning and they slowly lead to all the bad emotions towards the end. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Inspiration came from many different games because of the split of game mechanics, but in terms of a general inspiration 
                the game that it most related to was Journey. This project was also a journey for the player, and it would end with two 
                different yet basic results, which would also be open to interpretation. Themes included in this game included a Mayan/Aztec 
                setting built in a forest like area however this doesn’t reflect on the character designs, where the all the characters in 
                the game would be “diamond humanoids”. The reason for the creative decision was based on the idea that it represents a 
                reflection of the person who is currently in this dreamscape and would also be a good method to express the emotions where 
                the character hues would change with each section, but this would only relate to the main character and not anyone else in 
                the game and not the other characters. To also create this dreamscape type of environment, the NPC’s of the game would look 
                similar but with key differences depending the relevance of said character. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With each emotion, the game was going to have separate game mechanics for each one expressed signifying the change 
                in both the character and the visual story. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The happiness section starts with the main character getting familiar with the dreamscape environment, being introduced 
                to his good life, a life with his mother, surrounded by good friend and the friendly people in his village. This section 
                introduces a few mini-games with few text-based activities, giving a “calm before the storm” scenario. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Trust is also integrated with happiness, but with the addition of a puzzle challenge introduce by the character mother, 
                giving the impression that trust is being developed for the player. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Sadness is the biggest twist, where an unnerving and traumatic even happens that effects the player. The whole community 
                has a gathering and a big monster appears. Named “The Third Sun”, this creature causes devastating damage the whole village 
                as everyone proceeds to flee. The players “mother” is killed because of this creature and no one proceeds to help the 
                character out of the fleeing situation; proceeding to the next chapter. This section in terms of the game mechanic becomes a 
                simple running scene as all things around you are being turned to ash.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anger replaces the simple running section to turn in to a “hack’n’slash’ mechanic to represent the rage after suffering from the 
                loss of his mother and no one willing to provide any support, so the character becomes delusional seeing shadows of his 
                fellow villagers and proceeds to attack them, at some point he stops from the releasing all that rage he moves on to a dark 
                part of the forest where he will encounter a dark figment of his “mother” and the return of “The Third Sun”. This also 
                connects together with Disgust as these would be stuck together during the aftermath of his violent rage. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Fear being the final part of the game becomes a stealth section where the player has to make his way through without 
                being noticed by “The Third Sun”, keeping a linear route similar to the game Journey where the player is avoiding trouble. 
                Once the player reaches the end of the section, the player must make a choice being either jumping off a cliff and the 
                character wakes up from his dream to a happy life, or alternatively a sad ending where you stay with the dark figure of the 
                characters “mother” and continue to wallow in sadness.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The ending presents the idea that with enough pain there is normally two options, you either look back on your past, let go and 
                move on or you stay there in the same place you where, still sad and unable to move on. This line is the most important part as it’s a 
                visual representation of what happens when someone goes through a lot of pain, presenting the question: Where does one go emotionally 
                after such a life-changing event?
