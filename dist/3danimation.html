        <p class="paragraph-container">
            Here are illustrations of my work, these models were created using Maya. Even though these models are untextured;
             a UV mapping has been implemented so that it will allow for a texturing to be easily applied onto the model. 
             Each model has an inspired or unique look depending on the gaming genre. 
        </p>

        <h2 class="sub-title"> Neo-Tokyo Bike </h2>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>
                During the creation of an unfinished project, the idea was to create multiple vehicles that would be part 
                of a “kart” type experience, but the model also had to feel as part of the world's lore. 
            </p>

            <p>
                The aim of this project was for it to be set in a dystopian post-apocalyptic world, 
                this opened opportunities of expanding the racetracks, vehicles and locations and with each 
                vehicle we had a character and lore. This bike was supposed to be a futuristic motorbike that was built in New Tokyo, 
                a cyber-punk city. The design of this model was inspired from Akira, including the spiked tires, although this initially 
                did not correlate with the theme, but the character’s backstory justifies the design.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-title"> D Scales Truck </h2>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>
                This was also part of the unfinished “kart” project. The model of this truck was inspired by the film Mad Max: 
                Fury Road with the truck being rusted and modified, with in-built weapons that would attack the other contestants 
                in the race and the reptilian elements on the vehicle was correlated to the character’s lore who was an alligator 
                humanoid figure and the track race was set to be in Colorado. 
             </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-title"> Tortoise </h2>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>
                Tortoise is a model designed for an upcoming project that I am working with a friend which revolves around spirit animals. 
                This model is rigged and can set states such as walk, run and more. The character is inspired by Oogway 
                from Kung Fu Panda.
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-title"> Flame Boss </h2>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>
                The flame boss, which is an enraged spirit that threatens the spirit world, starts of as an entity but as you 
                progress throughout the story; it shall reveal itself. The design is kept simple and clean with UV mapping 
                added and, in the future, textured.  
            </p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="sub-title"> Box-Man </h2>
        <div class="paragraph-container">
            <p>
                This character was designed for my own personal project. I wanted to create a basic character that would have a set 
                of animations of it fighting, using sword and shield. This model has a fully fleshed out UV mapping.
