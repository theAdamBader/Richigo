                I am currently working on a project whilst coming up with other concepts of future projects, as 
                a Game Designer, I enjoy coming up with concept designs and how the project should play and feel. 
                I focus on how the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics of each project and how they should be played as 
                consumers will look at the aesthetics of the game first then the dynamics (which is the gameplay) and 
                finally the mechanics of how each input would affect the game.
            </p>

            <p>Here are some projects that I am currently working on:</p>

        <h2> Project JunkRace </h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                Project JunkRace, the initial idea was to create a mobile game that was a karting game with steam-punk, 
                post-apocalyptic elements presented throughout. To make the experience a lot more different from other karting 
                games was the apply cool-downs and character specific vehicles to the game. The inspirations for the game took 
                elements from other games such as Mario kart, Overwatch and League of Legends.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Each character would also have their own specific abilities on a cool-down timer, which would have to be 
                thoroughly tested to see which can be over-used and over-powered. 
            </p>
            <p>
                There were plans to either make characters have character specific cool-downs or just cool-down abilities that every 
                character can use. We already thought to restrict the abilities to 2 cool-downs and 1 Ultimate ability.  Even though 
                the initial idea of cool-downs was interesting, it was decided that with the character specific cool-downs it would only 
                be limited to 2 cool-downs per character without having the need to change them so they would be fixed and easier to understand.  
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition, the idea was to have at least 6 different characters that have different vehicles/play-styles, with the decision 
                of splitting the characters into two separate but easy to understand classes; one class being light and the other being heavy 
                vehicles. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For the beginning or the prototype stage, two stages were created for the racers. One was a moving spider stage whilst the other was 
                a simple canyon looking arena. Both of these stages had their own secrets to uncover to make them more interesting for the 
                player, mostly they had just shortcuts to allow for diverse play. 
            </p>

        <h2> Project Diamonds </h2>
        <div>
            <p>
                This project was a conceptual story focusing around telling a dream-like narrative. It was designed around the 
                idea of a person’s emotions and the emotional journey they go on, through a dreamscape. The basic concept of 
                the story was that the protagonist goes through a tide of emotions in one day, progressively experiencing the 
                loss during this journey and what solutions they would have reached at the end of the road. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This required extensive research into emotions and how they need to be separated for the game. Some emotions 
                can mix in between, and it was imperative that they were conveyed correctly. The key emotions that are: 
                happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and trust. The idea was to split each emotion and present different 
                mechanics with them. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The themes included in this game included a Mayan/Aztec setting built in a forest-like area however, this does 
                not reflect on the character’s designs. Being a dreamscape, the character design was to represent a reflection 
                of the person who is playing the game.
            </p>

                The happiness section introduces a few mini-games with a few text-based activities, giving a “calm before the storm” 
                scenario. Trust introduces a puzzle challenge and more characters get introduced.

                Sadness causes the biggest twist which relays into the other emotions where an unnerving and traumatic event happens. 
                This section in terms of the game mechanics becomes a simple rum and dodge, and slowly leads to anger which replaces 
                the simple running section and turns it into a hack ‘n’ slash section, making the player beat his delusions. Fear being 
                the final part of the game becomes a stealth section where the player must make his way through without being noticed. 
                This leads to an ending which has two choices, the player will either choose a good or bad ending.
