class=\"paragraph-container\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                I am currently working on a project whilst coming up with other concepts of future projects, as \r\n                a Game Designer, I enjoy coming up with concept designs and how the project should play and feel. \r\n                I focus on how the mechanics, dynamics and aesthetics of each project and how they should be played as \r\n                consumers will look at the aesthetics of the game first then the dynamics (which is the gameplay) and \r\n                finally the mechanics of how each input would affect the game.\r\n            </p>\r\n\r\n            <p>Here are some projects that I am currently working on:</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n\r\n        <h2 class=\"sub-title\"> Project JunkRace </h2>\r\n        <div class=\"paragraph-container\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                Project JunkRace, the initial idea was to create a mobile game that was a karting game with steam-punk, \r\n                post-apocalyptic elements presented throughout. To make the experience a lot more different from other karting \r\n                games was the apply cool-downs and character specific vehicles to the game. The inspirations for the game took \r\n                elements from other games such as Mario kart, Overwatch and League of Legends.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Each character would also have their own specific abilities on a cool-down timer, which would have to be \r\n                thoroughly tested to see which can be over-used and over-powered. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                There were plans to either make characters have character specific cool-downs or just cool-down abilities that every \r\n                character can use. We already thought to restrict the abilities to 2 cool-downs and 1 Ultimate ability.  Even though \r\n                the initial idea of cool-downs was interesting, it was decided that with the character specific cool-downs it would only \r\n                be limited to 2 cool-downs per character without having the need to change them so they would be fixed and easier to understand.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                In addition, the idea was to have at least 6 different characters that have different vehicles/play-styles, with the decision \r\n                of splitting the characters into two separate but easy to understand classes; one class being light and the other being heavy \r\n                vehicles. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                For the beginning or the prototype stage, two stages were created for the racers. One was a moving spider stage whilst the other was \r\n                a simple canyon looking arena. Both of these stages had their own secrets to uncover to make them more interesting for the \r\n                player, mostly they had just shortcuts to allow for diverse play. \r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <br>\r\n        <h2 class=\"sub-title\"> Project Diamonds </h2>\r\n        <div class=\"paragraph-container\">\r\n            <p>\r\n                This project was more of a conceptual story project focusing around telling a dream-like story. It was designed around \r\n                the idea of a person’s emotions and the emotional journey one would go on through a dreamscape.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The basic concept of the story is that our protagonist goes through a list of emotions in one day. The character will \r\n                progressively experience loss during this journey and it was going to show how the character comes to terms with what \r\n                is happening around him and how he deals with it; what solution would they come to when the reach the end of the road. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                I developed the idea and extensive research on the different types of emotions a person emanates, however when creating \r\n                this concept, the original plan was to make clear separations of each emotion which can be difficult because a majority \r\n                of them can co-exist together when expressing them. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The key emotions that are expressed from people are split as follows: happiness, sadness, anger, disgust, fear and trust. \r\n                Using this knowledge, they would have to be arranged in order to make a more coherent storyline, where the good emotions \r\n                are presented at the beginning and they slowly lead to all the bad emotions towards the end. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Inspiration came from many different games because of the split of game mechanics, but in terms of a general inspiration \r\n                the game that it most related to was Journey. This project was also a journey for the player, and it would end with two \r\n                different yet basic results, which would also be open to interpretation. Themes included in this game included a Mayan/Aztec \r\n                setting built in a forest like area however this doesn’t reflect on the character designs, where the all the characters in \r\n                the game would be “diamond humanoids”. The reason for the creative decision was based on the idea that it represents a \r\n                reflection of the person who is currently in this dreamscape and would also be a good method to express the emotions where \r\n                the character hues would change with each section, but this would only relate to the main character and not anyone else in \r\n                the game and not the other characters. To also create this dreamscape type of environment, the NPC’s of the game would look \r\n                similar but with key differences depending the relevance of said character. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                With each emotion, the game was going to have separate game mechanics for each one expressed signifying the change \r\n                in both the character and the visual story. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The happiness section starts with the main character getting familiar with the dreamscape environment, being introduced \r\n                to his good life, a life with his mother, surrounded by good friend and the friendly people in his village. This section \r\n                introduces a few mini-games with few text-based activities, giving a “calm before the storm” scenario. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Trust is also integrated with happiness, but with the addition of a puzzle challenge introduce by the character mother, \r\n                giving the impression that trust is being developed for the player. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Sadness is the biggest twist, where an unnerving and traumatic even happens that effects the player. The whole community \r\n                has a gathering and a big monster appears. Named “The Third Sun”, this creature causes devastating damage the whole village \r\n                as everyone proceeds to flee. The players “mother” is killed because of this creature and no one proceeds to help the \r\n                character out of the fleeing situation; proceeding to the next chapter. This section in terms of the game mechanic becomes a \r\n                simple running scene as all things around you are being turned to ash.\r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Anger replaces the simple running section to turn in to a “hack’n’slash’ mechanic to represent the rage after suffering from the \r\n                loss of his mother and no one willing to provide any support, so the character becomes delusional seeing shadows of his \r\n                fellow villagers and proceeds to attack them, at some point he stops from the releasing all that rage he moves on to a dark \r\n                part of the forest where he will encounter a dark figment of his “mother” and the return of “The Third Sun”. This also \r\n                connects together with Disgust as these would be stuck together during the aftermath of his violent rage. \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                Fear being the final part of the game becomes a stealth section where the player has to make his way through without \r\n                being noticed by “The Third Sun”, keeping a linear route similar to the game Journey where the player is avoiding trouble. \r\n                Once the player reaches the end of the section, the player must make a choice being either jumping off a cliff and the \r\n                character wakes up from his dream to a happy life, or alternatively a sad ending where you stay with the dark figure of the \r\n                characters “mother” and continue to wallow in sadness.  \r\n            </p>\r\n            <p>\r\n                The ending presents the idea that with enough pain there is normally two options, you either look back on your past, let go and \r\n                move on or you stay there in the same place you where, still sad and unable to move on. This line is the most important part as it’s a \r\n                visual representation of what happens when someone goes through a lot of pain, presenting the question: Where does one go emotionally \r\n                after such a life-changing event? \r\n            </p>\r\n        </div>\r\n    </div>\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n  \t<!-- JavaScript/jQuery  -->\r\n    <script src=\"https://code.jquery.com/jquery-3.4.1.js\"></script>\r\n    <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/0460ffbade5ffe1d20b48e6087f08830.js\"></script>\r\n\t<script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"/659bff98bec4828464bc4801d7fc672b.js\"></script>\r\n    \r\n\r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"0c281542b896281e5fc72526a5e7b82c","cacheData":{}}
